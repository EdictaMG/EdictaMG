# About me

Hi! I am Edicta and I am glad you are here. 

I have been in the not-for-profit sector since 2005.  I find it deeply satisfying to work directly with people of all backgrounds and communities, and to contribute to causes that support individual and social development practices. Equally rewarding is looking at data, trends, and patterns to help me make sense of my environment, whether near, far, visible or invisible.

I believe that data, after accounting for reliability, accuracy and relevance, offers incredibly important opportunities in advancing towards desirable outcomes and impact. This convinction underscores my engagement with building bridges between data, people and strategies.

That is me for now.  Stay in touch!
