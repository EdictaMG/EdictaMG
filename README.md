# About me

Hi! I'm Edicta, and I'm glad you are here. 

I've been working in the not-for-profit sector since 2005. I find it deeply rewarding to work alongside people from all backgrounds and communities, contributing to causes that promote individual and social development. Equally meaningful to me is exploring data, trends, and patterns to better understand the world around meâ€”whether that world is near or far, visible or invisible.

I believe that data, after accounting for reliability, accuracy and relevance, becomes a powerful tool for driving positive outcomes and impact. This conviction underscores my engagement with building bridges between data, people and strategies.

That's me for now.  Feel free to stay in touch!
